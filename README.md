# BBC-News-Classifier
KNN &amp; SVM classifiers on BBC News Categories

This work aims to build a News classifier, to identify News from 5 categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport and tech. Two classifying techniques, KNN and SVM, are applied for comparisons. The classifier is built upon 2225 [BBC News Datasets](http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html) from 2005-2006. Datasets can be found under the folder __bbc-fulltext__.

**R Packages used:**
* tm: Text-Mining Package
* plyr: Tools for Splitting, Applying and Combining Data
* class: Functions for Classification __(used: knn)__
* e1071: Functions for latent class analysis, fuzzy clustering, svm, bagged clustering, naive Bayes classifier... __(used: svm)__
